# Wowchemy Documentation

This is the public repository for [Wowchemy Documentation](http://wowchemy.com/docs/), a static website generated with the [Documentation template](https://wowchemy.com/hugo-themes/).

We intend the docs to be read on the website. You can also read them here but be warned that links won't often work and other things may appear missing or less than optimal.

## Edit the docs

If you have an improvement, please click the pencil button to edit the file on GitHub and then click the _Commit_ (save) button to easily submit it as a PR for review.

Otherwise, if you cannot find the file to edit in this repo, please open an issue with the improved text or suggestion.
